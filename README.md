# Snake Game

This is an exercise for me to practice front/back end with all the basics.
Here we implement a simple Snake game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
On the backend, we use Vercel along with MangoDB to make it a bit more interesting.

For me, the most important part was to make it a challenge for everyone.
So, there is a global leaderboard! If you are the best player, YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED!

But, it's a bit buggy lol.
